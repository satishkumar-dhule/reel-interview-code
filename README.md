## 🔄 Automated Workflows

All bots run daily to ensure continuous content management and quality maintenance.

### Daily Question Generator
**Trigger:** Daily at 00:00 UTC (or manual via workflow_dispatch)

Automatically generates new technical interview questions using OpenCode AI:
- Generates 5 new questions per run
- Randomly selects channels and difficulty levels
- Smart deduplication to prevent duplicates
- Adds mermaid diagrams and detailed explanations
- Commits changes and triggers deployment

```bash
# Manual trigger
gh workflow run daily-question.yml -f channel=algorithms -f difficulty=intermediate
```

### Question Improvement Bot
**Trigger:** Daily at 06:00 UTC (or manual via workflow_dispatch)

Automatically improves existing questions:
- Improves 5 questions per run
- Prioritizes oldest questions for review
- Identifies issues: short answers, missing diagrams, truncated content
- Uses OpenCode to enhance content
- Adds/improves mermaid diagrams
- Optimizes word count and formatting
- Commits improvements and triggers deployment

```bash
# Manual trigger
gh workflow run improve-question.yml
```

### Question Deduplication Bot
**Trigger:** Daily at 12:00 UTC (or manual via workflow_dispatch)

Automatically removes duplicate questions:
- Analyzes a random channel each run
- Uses Jaccard similarity (60%+ threshold) to detect duplicates
- Removes at most 1 duplicate per run (keeps oldest, removes newest)
- Maintains question quality and uniqueness
- Provides detailed duplicate analysis
- Commits changes and triggers deployment

```bash
# Manual trigger
gh workflow run deduplicate-questions.yml
```

### Workflow Schedule

| Bot | Time (UTC) | Frequency | Purpose |
|-----|-----------|-----------|---------|
| Daily Question Generator | 00:00 | Daily | Add new questions |
| Question Improvement Bot | 06:00 | Daily | Improve existing questions |
| Question Deduplication Bot | 12:00 | Daily | Remove duplicates |
| Deploy Workflow | On-demand | Triggered | Deploy changes |

This ensures continuous content addition, improvement, and quality maintenance throughout the day.
