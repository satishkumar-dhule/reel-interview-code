  // CASE QUALITY
  'Find cases from REAL, well-known companies - not hypothetical scenarios',
  'Prioritize cases with SPECIFIC, MEASURABLE outcomes (numbers, percentages, scale)',
  'Look for cases that had REAL STAKES - production incidents, scaling challenges, cost issues',
  'The best cases have a "plot twist" - something unexpected or counterintuitive',
  
  // SOURCE REQUIREMENT - CRITICAL
  'You MUST provide a sourceUrl for every case - this is required for citation',
  'Use stable URLs from: Wikipedia, engineering blogs, conference talks, news articles',
  'Preferred sources: Wikipedia articles, GitHub repos, official docs, well-known tech news',
  'The sourceUrl must be a real, verifiable link to where this story is documented',
  
  // SCORING CRITERIA
  'Score 9-10: Famous incident/case study, specific numbers, surprising outcome, widely discussed',
  'Score 7-8: Real company case, good details, clear lesson, moderately well-known',
  'Score 5-6: Generic application, lacks specific details, common knowledge',
  'Score 1-4: Hypothetical, no real company, or topic too abstract for real-world case',
  
  // WHAT MAKES A CASE INTERESTING
  'Production incidents that taught hard lessons (Knight Capital, AWS outages, etc.)',
  'Scaling stories with before/after metrics',
  'Cost optimization wins with dollar amounts',
  'Performance improvements with latency/throughput numbers',
  'Architecture decisions that enabled growth',
  
  // WHEN TO RETURN NULL
  'Return null for company if the topic is too theoretical/academic',
  'Return null if you can only think of generic/hypothetical examples',
  'Return null if the "case" would just be "Company X uses technology Y"',
  'Be honest - a low score with null company is better than a made-up case',
  
  // COMPANIES TO CONSIDER
  'FAANG: Netflix, Google, Amazon, Meta, Apple',
  'Fintech: Stripe, Square, Robinhood, Coinbase',
  'Ride-sharing: Uber, Lyft, DoorDash',
  'Travel: Airbnb, Booking.com, Expedia',
  'Social: Twitter/X, LinkedIn, Discord, Slack',
  'E-commerce: Shopify, Etsy, eBay',
  'Gaming: Epic Games, Riot, Roblox',
  'Streaming: Spotify, Twitch, Disney+',
  'Infrastructure: Cloudflare, Datadog, PagerDuty'

Find a COMPELLING real-world case study for this technical topic.

Your goal: Find a case that would make developers say "Oh wow, I didn't know that!" or "That's exactly the problem I'm facing!"

TOPIC DETAILS:
Question: ${question}
Answer: ${answer || 'N/A'}
Explanation: ${explanation || 'N/A'}
Channel: ${channel}
Tags: ${tags.join(', ')}
${companies.length > 0 ? `Companies mentioned: ${companies.join(', ')}` : ''}

DISCOVERY GUIDELINES:
${guidelines.map(g => `- ${g}`).join('\n')}

IMPORTANT:
- Only return a case if it's GENUINELY interesting and REAL
- If you can't find a compelling case, return null for company and explain why
- The interestScore should honestly reflect how engaging this case would be
- A score below 6 means we should skip this topic for blog generation
