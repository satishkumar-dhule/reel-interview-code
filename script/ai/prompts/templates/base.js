STRICT MARKDOWN FORMATTING RULES (MUST FOLLOW):

1. BOLD TEXT:
   - Use **text** with NO spaces inside: **correct** not ** incorrect **
   - Bold markers must be on the SAME LINE as the text: **Title** not **\\nTitle**
   - Never put ** on its own line
   - Never use ** immediately before or after code blocks

2. LISTS:
   - Each list item MUST be on its own line
   - Use "- " for bullets (dash + space)
   - Use "1. " for numbered lists (number + dot + space)
   - Add blank line before and after lists
   - Never combine multiple list items on one line

3. CODE BLOCKS:
   - Code fences (\`\`\`) MUST be on their own line
   - Never put ** markers inside code blocks
   - Always specify language: \`\`\`javascript not \`\`\`
   - Add blank line before and after code blocks

4. HEADINGS:
   - Use ## for main sections, ### for subsections
   - Add blank line after headings
   - Never use ** for headings, use # syntax

5. STRUCTURE:
   - Separate sections with blank lines
   - No trailing spaces at end of lines
   - Use proper paragraph breaks (blank line between paragraphs)

BAD EXAMPLES (DO NOT DO):
- "**\\n2. Title**" (bold split across lines)
- "**Item1**- **Item2**" (no newline between items)
- "text**\`\`\`code" (bold touching code fence)
- "- item1- item2" (multiple items on one line)

GOOD EXAMPLES:
- "**Title**" (bold on same line)
- "**Item1**\\n- **Item2**" (proper line breaks)
- "text\\n\\n\`\`\`javascript\\ncode\\n\`\`\`" (proper code block)
- "- item1\\n- item2" (each item on own line)
