  // STORYTELLING FOCUS
  'Write like youre telling a story to a friend over coffee, not writing documentation',
  'Start with a HOOK: a problem, a failure, a "picture this" moment, or a provocative question',
  'Example hooks: "It was 3am when the pager went off...", "Picture this: your CEO just tweeted about the new feature...", "Everyone told me this was the right approach. They were wrong."',
  'Build TENSION: what could go wrong? what are the stakes? why should they care?',
  'Use the "hero journey" structure: Problem → Struggle → Discovery → Solution → Transformation',
  'Include "plot twists" - counterintuitive insights that challenge assumptions',
  'End sections with cliffhangers or questions that pull readers forward',
  
  // VOICE & TONE
  'Write for a developer with ~3 years experience - they know the basics, show them the nuances',
  'Be conversational: use "you", "we", "I" - like youre pair programming',
  'Add personality: opinions, hot takes, things that surprised you',
  'Include "confession" moments: "I used to think X, until I learned Y"',
  'Use humor and wit naturally - dont force it, but dont be dry either',
  
  // REAL-WORLD GROUNDING
  'Every concept needs a "when would I actually use this?" answer',
  'Include a REAL company war story (Netflix, Uber, Stripe, etc.) - what broke, how they fixed it',
  'Add "battle scars" - common mistakes and how to avoid them',
  'Include specific numbers: latency, throughput, cost savings, team size',
  
  // STRUCTURE & FORMAT
  'Sections should flow like chapters in a story, not disconnected topics',
  'Use bullet lists for "heres what you need to know" moments',
  'Use tables for comparisons: "Option A vs Option B - heres the real tradeoff"',
  'Include a Mermaid diagram that tells the visual story',
  'Use callouts strategically: 💡 Insight, ⚠️ Watch Out, 🔥 Hot Take, 🎯 Key Point',
  
  // SOURCES & CREDIBILITY - CRITICAL
  'MUST include AT LEAST 12 credible sources with REAL, WORKING URLs',
  'USE ONLY these stable URL patterns that actually exist:',
  '  - Wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/[Topic]',
  '  - MDN: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/...',
  '  - GitHub repos: https://github.com/[org]/[repo]',
  '  - ArXiv papers: https://arxiv.org/abs/[paper-id]',
  '  - RFC docs: https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc[number]',
  '  - Python docs: https://docs.python.org/3/...',
  '  - AWS docs: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/...',
  '  - Kubernetes: https://kubernetes.io/docs/...',
  '  - DigitalOcean tutorials: https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/...',
  'DO NOT make up URLs - only use URLs you are confident exist',
  'DO NOT use company engineering blog URLs (netflix, uber, stripe blogs) - they frequently 404',
  
  // ENDING
  'Conclude with the "so what?" - what should they do differently tomorrow?',
  'Leave them with one memorable insight they can share with their team',
  
  // SOCIAL SNIPPET (for sharing)
  'Create a socialSnippet that is ready to copy-paste to LinkedIn/Twitter',
  'Hook: Start with a provocative statement or surprising stat with emoji (🔥💡🚀)',
  'Body: 3-4 bullet points that create urgency/FOMO - use numbers, percentages, bold claims',
  'CTA: End with curiosity gap - hint at what they will learn without giving it away',
  'Use line breaks for readability, keep it under 300 words total',
  'Make it feel like insider knowledge being shared'
