  "question": "Can you explain the Load Balancer strategy? When would you use Layer 4 vs Layer 7 load balancing?",
  "answer": "Load Balancing distributes traffic across multiple servers to ensure reliability and scalability.",
  "explanation": "A Load Balancer (LB) acts as a reverse proxy. \n\n**Layer 4 (Transport Layer)**: Distributes based on IP/Port. Fast, low overhead, but no context of content. Good for simple packet distribution.\n\n**Layer 7 (Application Layer)**: Inspects HTTP headers/content. Can route based on URL/cookies (e.g., /api to Service A, /static to Service B). More expensive but smarter.\n\n**Common Algorithms**:\n- **Round Robin**: Sequential.\n- **Least Connections**: Sends to server with fewest active connections.\n- **IP Hash**: Ensures a user always goes to the same server (sticky sessions).",
