  "question": "Write a function to find the maximum depth of a binary tree.",
  "answer": "Use recursive DFS: return 1 + max(depth(left), depth(right)) for each node.",
  "explanation": "The maximum depth of a binary tree is the length of the longest path from the root to a leaf node. We can solve this using depth-first search (DFS) recursion. For each node, we calculate the depth of its left and right subtrees, then return 1 (for the current node) plus the maximum of these two depths. The base case is when we reach a null node, which has depth 0.",
