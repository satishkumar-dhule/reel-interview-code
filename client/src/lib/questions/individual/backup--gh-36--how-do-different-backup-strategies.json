  "question": "How do different backup strategies balance storage efficiency, backup speed, and recovery time?",
  "answer": "Full backups copy everything, incremental saves only changes since last backup, differential saves changes since last full backup.",
  "explanation": "Backup strategies balance three key factors: storage space, backup duration, and recovery speed.\n\n## **Full Backup**\n- **What**: Complete copy of all data\n- **Storage**: Highest usage (100% of data size)\n- **Speed**: Slowest backup process\n- **Recovery**: Fastest - single restore operation\n- **Use case**: Weekly/monthly baseline, critical systems\n\n## **Incremental Backup**\n- **What**: Only changes since last backup (any type)\n- **Storage**: Lowest usage (only changed data)\n- **Speed**: Fastest backup process\n- **Recovery**: Slowest - need full + all incremental backups\n- **Use case**: Daily backups, large datasets with limited change\n\n## **Differential Backup**\n- **What**: Changes since last full backup\n- **Storage**: Medium usage (grows until next full)\n- **Speed**: Medium backup process\n- **Recovery**: Medium - need full + latest differential\n- **Use case**: When faster recovery needed than incremental\n\n## **Strategy Examples**\n- **Grandfather-Father-Son**: Monthly full + weekly differential + daily incremental\n- **Tower of Hanoi**: Rotating backup schedule with different retention periods\n- **3-2-1 Rule**: 3 copies, 2 different media, 1 offsite location",
