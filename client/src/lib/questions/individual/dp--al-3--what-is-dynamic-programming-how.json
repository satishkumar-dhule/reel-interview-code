  "question": "What is Dynamic Programming? How is it different from Recursion?",
  "answer": "DP is Recursion + Optimization (Memoization/Tabulation).",
  "explanation": "Recursion solves subproblems blindly (potentially repeating work).\n\n**DP** stores the result of subproblems so you never solve the same problem twice.\n\n**Example**: Fibonacci.\n- Recursion: `fib(n-1) + fib(n-2)` -> O(2^n)\n- DP: Store `fib` array -> O(n)\n\n**Two Approaches**:\n1. Top-Down (Memoization)\n2. Bottom-Up (Tabulation)",
