  "question": "Describe a time when you had to work with a difficult team member. How did you handle the situation and what was the outcome?",
  "answer": "I focused on understanding their perspective, found common ground, and established clear communication protocols.",
  "explanation": "This behavioral question assesses your interpersonal skills, conflict resolution abilities, and emotional intelligence. A strong answer should demonstrate: 1) Self-awareness in recognizing the difficulty, 2) Empathy in understanding the other person's perspective, 3) Proactive communication strategies, 4) Focus on team goals over personal differences, 5) Ability to turn a negative situation into a positive outcome. The STAR method (Situation, Task, Action, Result) works well here. Key indicators of a good response include taking ownership of the solution rather than blaming, showing respect for the difficult person, and demonstrating how the experience improved team dynamics.",
