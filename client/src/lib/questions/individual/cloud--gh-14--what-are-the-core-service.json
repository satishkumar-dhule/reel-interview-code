  "question": "What are the core service categories in Microsoft Azure and how do they work together to support cloud applications?",
  "answer": "Azure provides compute, storage, networking, and database services that integrate to build scalable cloud solutions.",
  "explanation": "Microsoft Azure is a comprehensive cloud computing platform offering multiple service categories:\n\n**Compute Services:**\n- Virtual Machines - IaaS for custom OS environments\n- App Service - PaaS for web applications\n- Azure Functions - Serverless compute for event-driven workloads\n- Container Instances - Containerized application hosting\n\n**Storage Services:**\n- Blob Storage - Object storage for unstructured data\n- File Storage - Managed file shares\n- Queue Storage - Message queuing service\n- Table Storage - NoSQL key-value store\n\n**Networking Services:**\n- Virtual Network - Isolated network environments\n- Load Balancer - Traffic distribution\n- Application Gateway - Web traffic load balancer with SSL termination\n- VPN Gateway - Secure connections to on-premises\n\n**Database Services:**\n- SQL Database - Managed relational database\n- Cosmos DB - Multi-model NoSQL database\n- Redis Cache - In-memory data store\n\nThese services integrate seamlessly, allowing applications to scale horizontally across regions while maintaining security and performance.",
