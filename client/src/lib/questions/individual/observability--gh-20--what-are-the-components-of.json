  "question": "What are the components of the ELK Stack and how do they work together to process log data?",
  "answer": "The ELK Stack is a centralized logging solution consisting of Elasticsearch (search engine), Logstash (data processing), and Kibana (visualization).",
  "explanation": "The ELK Stack is a comprehensive log management and analytics platform:\n\n## Components:\n\n* **Elasticsearch:** Distributed search and analytics engine that stores and indexes data\n* **Logstash:** Data collection and transformation pipeline that processes logs from multiple sources\n* **Kibana:** Visualization dashboard for exploring and analyzing data stored in Elasticsearch\n\n## Data Flow:\n\n1. Logstash collects logs from various sources (applications, servers, services)\n2. Logstash processes, filters, and transforms the log data\n3. Processed data is indexed and stored in Elasticsearch\n4. Kibana provides real-time dashboards and visualizations for analysis\n\n## Common Use Cases:\n\n* Centralized log aggregation\n* Security monitoring and threat detection\n* Application performance monitoring\n* Business intelligence and analytics\n* Debugging and troubleshooting",
