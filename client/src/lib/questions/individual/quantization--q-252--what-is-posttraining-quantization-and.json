  "question": "What is post-training quantization and how does it reduce model size without retraining?",
  "answer": "Converting model weights from 32-bit to lower precision (8-bit or 16-bit) after training, reducing memory by 4-75%.",
  "explanation": "## Post-Training Quantization\n\nPost-training quantization optimizes models by reducing numerical precision of weights after training is complete.\n\n### Key Concepts\n- **Quantization**: Process of reducing precision of numbers (e.g., 32-bit → 8-bit)\n- **Static vs Dynamic**: Static quantizes all parameters upfront, dynamic quantizes during inference\n- **Trade-offs**: Smaller model size vs. potential accuracy loss\n\n### Implementation Details\n```python\n# PyTorch example of post-training quantization\nimport torch\nfrom torch import quantization\n\nmodel = load_trained_model()\n# Static quantization\nmodel_int8 = quantization.quantize_dynamic(\n    model, {torch.nn.Linear}, dtype=torch.qint8\n)\n```\n\n### Common Pitfalls\n- Accuracy degradation with extreme precision reduction (4-bit)\n- Hardware compatibility issues (not all devices support 8-bit ops)\n- Calibration data quality affects dynamic quantization performance",
