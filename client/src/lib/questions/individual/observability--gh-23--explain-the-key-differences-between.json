  "question": "Explain the key differences between monitoring and logging in DevOps, and when would you use each?",
  "answer": "Monitoring tracks system health and performance metrics in real-time, while logging records discrete events for troubleshooting and analysis.",
  "explanation": "## Key Differences\n\n### **Monitoring**\n- **Purpose**: Real-time system health tracking\n- **Data Type**: Metrics, performance indicators\n- **Usage**: Alerting, trend analysis, SLA compliance\n- **Examples**: CPU usage, response times, error rates\n- **Tools**: Prometheus, Grafana, Datadog\n\n### **Logging**\n- **Purpose**: Event recording and debugging\n- **Data Type**: Discrete events, messages\n- **Usage**: Root cause analysis, security auditing\n- **Examples**: Application errors, user actions, system events\n- **Tools**: ELK Stack, Splunk, Graylog\n\n### **When to Use Each**\n- **Monitoring**: System health dashboards, proactive alerts\n- **Logging**: Debugging specific issues, audit trails",
