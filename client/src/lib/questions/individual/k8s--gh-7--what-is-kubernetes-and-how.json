  "question": "What is Kubernetes and how does it orchestrate containerized applications at scale?",
  "answer": "Kubernetes is an open-source container orchestration platform that automates deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications across clusters of hosts.",
  "explanation": "**Kubernetes (K8s)** is a production-grade container orchestration platform that manages containerized applications at scale.\n\n## Core Capabilities:\n- **Automated Deployment**: Roll out new versions with zero downtime\n- **Self-Healing**: Restart failed containers and replace unhealthy nodes\n- **Horizontal Scaling**: Automatically adjust application instances based on load\n- **Service Discovery**: Enable containers to find and communicate with each other\n- **Load Balancing**: Distribute traffic across multiple container instances\n- **Storage Orchestration**: Manage persistent storage for stateful applications\n\n## Key Components:\n- **Master Node**: Control plane (API Server, Scheduler, Controller Manager)\n- **Worker Nodes**: Run containerized applications (Kubelet, Container Runtime)\n- **Pods**: Smallest deployable units containing one or more containers\n- **Services**: Network endpoints for accessing pods\n- **Deployments**: Manage pod replicas and rolling updates\n\n## Why Use Kubernetes:\n- **Portability**: Run anywhere (on-prem, cloud, hybrid)\n- **Scalability**: Handle thousands of containers and nodes\n- **Reliability**: Built-in fault tolerance and recovery mechanisms\n- **Ecosystem**: Extensive tooling and community support",
