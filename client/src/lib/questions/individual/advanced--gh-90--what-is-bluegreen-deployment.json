  "explanation": "Blue/Green Deployment is a continuous deployment strategy that aims to minimize downtime and risk by maintaining two identical production environments, referred to as \"Blue\" and \"Green.\" Only one environment serves live production traffic at any given time.\n\n**How it Works:**\n1.  **Live Environment (Blue):** The current production environment handling all user traffic.\n2.  **Staging/New Environment (Green):** An identical environment where the new version of the application is deployed and thoroughly tested.\n3.  **Traffic Switch:** Once the Green environment is verified, a router or load balancer redirects all incoming traffic from Blue to Green. The Green environment now becomes the live production environment.\n4.  **Rollback:** If issues are detected in the Green environment after the switch, traffic can be quickly routed back to the Blue environment (which still runs the old, stable version).\n5.  **Promotion:** After a period of monitoring the new Green environment, the Blue environment can be updated to the new version to become the staging environment for the next release, or it can be decommissioned.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    LB[Load Balancer] -->|Switch| Blue[\"Blue Env<br/>v1\"]\n    LB -->|Switch| Green[\"Green Env<br/>v2\"]\n    Blue -.->|Rollback| LB\n    style Blue fill:#3b82f6,stroke:#fff\n    style Green fill:#22c55e,stroke:#fff\n```\n\n**Benefits:**\n*   **Near-Zero Downtime:** Traffic is switched instantaneously.\n*   **Reduced Risk:** The new version is fully tested in an identical production environment before going live.\n*   **Rapid Rollback:** Reverting to the previous version is as simple as switching traffic back.\n*   **Simplified Release Process:** The process is straightforward and well-understood.\n\n**Considerations:**\n*   **Resource Costs:** Requires maintaining two full production environments, which can be expensive.\n*   **Database Compatibility:** Managing database schema changes and data synchronization between Blue and Green environments can be complex. Strategies like using backward-compatible changes or separate database instances are often employed.\n*   **Stateful Applications:** Handling user sessions and other stateful components requires careful planning during the switch.\n*   **Long-running Transactions:** Can be affected during the switchover.",
