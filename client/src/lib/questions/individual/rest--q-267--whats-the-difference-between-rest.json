  "question": "What's the difference between REST, GraphQL, and gRPC in terms of protocol and data format?",
  "answer": "REST uses HTTP/1.1 with JSON/XML, GraphQL uses HTTP with JSON, and gRPC uses HTTP/2 with Protocol Buffers.",
  "explanation": "## Concept\nREST is an architectural style using standard HTTP methods for resource-based operations. GraphQL is a query language allowing flexible data retrieval from single endpoints. gRPC is a high-performance RPC framework using contract-first design.\n\n## Implementation\n```javascript\n// REST\nGET /users/123\n\n// GraphQL\nquery { user(id: 123) { name, email } }\n\n// gRPC (protobuf)\nrpc GetUser(GetUserRequest) returns (UserResponse)\n```\n\n## Trade-offs\nREST: Simple, cacheable, but over/under-fetches data. GraphQL: Flexible queries, but complex server implementation. gRPC: Fast, type-safe, but HTTP/2 required and less browser-friendly.\n\n## Pitfalls\nREST suffers from N+1 queries. GraphQL can cause deep query complexity issues. gRPC requires protobuf compilation and tooling.",
