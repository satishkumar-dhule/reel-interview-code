  "question": "What is the primary difference between Ansible, Puppet, and Chef in configuration management?",
  "answer": "Ansible is agentless using SSH, while Puppet and Chef require agents on managed nodes.",
  "explanation": "## Concept\nConfiguration management tools automate software deployment and server configuration. They ensure consistency across environments and enable infrastructure as code practices.\n\n## Implementation (code)\n**Ansible (agentless):**\n```yaml\n- hosts: webservers\n  tasks:\n    - name: Install nginx\n      apt: name=nginx state=present\n```\n\n**Puppet (agent-based):**\n```puppet\npackage { 'nginx':\n  ensure => installed,\n}\nservice { 'nginx':\n  ensure => running,\n  enable => true,\n}\n```\n\n**Chef (agent-based):**\n```ruby\npackage 'nginx' do\n  action :install\nend\n\nservice 'nginx' do\n  action [:start, :enable]\nend\n```\n\n## Trade-offs\n- **Ansible**: Simple setup, no agents, good for smaller environments\n- **Puppet**: Strong declarative language, better for large enterprises\n- **Chef**: Ruby-based, flexible, steeper learning curve\n\n## Pitfalls\n- Ansible: Can be slow for large-scale operations\n- Puppet: Requires certificate management between master and agents\n- Chef: Complex setup, Ruby dependencies can be challenging",
