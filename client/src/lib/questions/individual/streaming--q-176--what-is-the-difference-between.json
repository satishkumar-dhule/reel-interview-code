  "question": "What is the difference between batch processing and stream processing in data engineering?",
  "answer": "Batch processes data in fixed chunks at intervals; stream processes data continuously as it arrives.",
  "explanation": "Batch processing collects data over a time period and processes it all at once, typically on a schedule (hourly/daily). It's good for large-scale analytics where latency isn't critical. Stream processing handles data in real-time as it arrives, enabling immediate insights and reactions. Stream processing is essential for use cases like fraud detection, real-time monitoring, and live dashboards where immediate action is required.",
