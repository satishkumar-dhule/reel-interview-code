  "question": "What is monitoring in DevOps and how does it differ from observability?",
  "answer": "Monitoring is the practice of collecting and analyzing system metrics to detect issues, while observability provides deeper insights into system behavior.",
  "explanation": "**Monitoring in DevOps** involves systematically collecting, analyzing, and acting on telemetry data to ensure system reliability and performance.\n\n## Key Components:\n\n### 1. Infrastructure Monitoring\n- **Metrics**: CPU, memory, disk usage, network throughput\n- **Health**: Server uptime, service availability, resource capacity\n- **Tools**: Prometheus, DataDog, New Relic\n\n### 2. Application Monitoring\n- **Performance**: Response times, latency, throughput\n- **Errors**: Exception rates, failure patterns, error budgets\n- **Business**: User engagement, conversion rates, feature adoption\n\n### 3. Log Management\n- **Collection**: Centralized log aggregation from all services\n- **Analysis**: Pattern recognition, root cause analysis\n- **Retention**: Compliance and forensic investigation\n\n### 4. Alerting Systems\n- **Thresholds**: Predefined limits trigger notifications\n- **Anomaly Detection**: ML-based identification of unusual patterns\n- **Escalation**: Tiered response procedures\n\n## Monitoring vs Observability:\n- **Monitoring**: Answers 'what' is happening (known metrics)\n- **Observability**: Answers 'why' it's happening (deep insights)\n- **Complementary**: Monitoring detects issues, observability explains them",
