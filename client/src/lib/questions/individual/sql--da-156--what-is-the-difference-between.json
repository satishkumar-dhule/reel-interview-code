  "question": "What is the difference between DELETE and TRUNCATE commands in SQL?",
  "answer": "DELETE removes rows one by one and can use WHERE; TRUNCATE removes all rows at once, faster but can't be filtered.",
  "explanation": "## DELETE vs TRUNCATE\n\n### DELETE Command\n- Removes rows one at a time\n- Can use WHERE clause to filter specific rows\n- Triggers are fired for each deleted row\n- Slower for large datasets\n- Transaction log records each row deletion\n- Can be rolled back\n\n```sql\nDELETE FROM users WHERE age < 18;\n```\n\n### TRUNCATE Command\n- Removes all rows at once\n- Cannot use WHERE clause (removes entire table data)\n- No triggers fired\n- Much faster for large datasets\n- Minimal transaction logging\n- Cannot be rolled back in most databases\n- Resets auto-increment counters\n\n```sql\nTRUNCATE TABLE users;\n```\n\n### When to Use Each\n- Use **DELETE** when you need to remove specific rows or need transaction safety\n- Use **TRUNCATE** when you need to quickly empty an entire table",
