  "question": "How do you handle Database Sharding? What are the downsides?",
  "answer": "Sharding splits a large database into smaller, faster, easily managed parts called data shards.",
  "explanation": "**Horizontal Partitioning**: Splitting rows based on a Shard Key (e.g., UserID).\n\n**Downsides/Challenges**:\n1. **Resharding**: Hard to move data when a shard fills up.\n2. **Hotspot Key**: If Justin Bieber is on Shard 1, Shard 1 melts down.\n3. **Joins**: Cross-shard joins are expensive/impossible.\n\n**Mitigation**: Consistent Hashing, Virtual Nodes.",
