  "question": "What is Infrastructure as Code and why has it become essential for modern DevOps practices?",
  "answer": "Infrastructure as Code (IaC) manages and provisions infrastructure through version-controlled definition files instead of manual configuration or interactive tools.",
  "explanation": "**Infrastructure as Code (IaC)** transforms infrastructure management by treating infrastructure like application code:\n\n• **Declarative Configuration**: Define desired infrastructure state using code (HCL, YAML, JSON)\n• **Version Control**: Track all infrastructure changes in Git with full audit history\n• **Automation**: Provision and manage resources programmatically without manual intervention\n• **Reproducibility**: Create identical environments consistently across development, staging, and production\n• **Collaboration**: Enable teams to review infrastructure changes through pull requests\n\n**Key Benefits:**\n- Eliminates configuration drift between environments\n- Reduces human errors from manual setup\n- Enables rapid environment provisioning\n- Provides audit trails for compliance\n- Supports disaster recovery through code recreation",
