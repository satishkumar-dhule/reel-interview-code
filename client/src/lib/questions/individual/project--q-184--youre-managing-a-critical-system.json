  "question": "You're managing a critical system migration with 3 teams working in parallel. Team A (backend) is 2 weeks behind, Team B (frontend) is on schedule but blocked by Team A, and Team C (DevOps) needs 1 more week for infrastructure setup. The go-live date is fixed in 6 weeks. What's your immediate action plan and risk mitigation strategy?",
  "answer": "Replan with critical path analysis, add resources to Team A, parallelize work, create buffer time.",
  "explanation": "This is a classic project management crisis scenario requiring immediate intervention. **Immediate Actions:**\n\n1. **Critical Path Analysis**: Identify that Team A is on the critical path - their delay impacts the entire project\n\n2. **Resource Reallocation**: \n   - Move 1-2 developers from Team C (who has buffer) to Team A\n   - Consider bringing in contract developers for Team A\n\n3. **Work Parallelization**:\n   - Team B can work on mock data/stubs while Team A catches up\n   - Team C can proceed with infrastructure setup independently\n\n4. **Risk Mitigation**:\n   - **Schedule Risk**: Implement daily standups, weekly reviews\n   - **Quality Risk**: Increase code review frequency, add automated testing\n   - **Team Burnout**: Monitor team health, consider overtime compensation\n\n5. **Stakeholder Communication**: \n   - Immediate update to leadership on revised timeline\n   - Transparent communication about risks and mitigation plans\n\n6. **Contingency Planning**:\n   - Prepare phased rollout if full migration isn't possible\n   - Identify minimum viable features for go-live\n\nThe key is balancing aggressive recovery with realistic expectations while maintaining team morale.",
