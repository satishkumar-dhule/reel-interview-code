  "question": "What is the difference between metrics, logs, and traces in observability, and when would you use each?",
  "answer": "Metrics: aggregated numbers over time. Logs: discrete events. Traces: request flow across services. Use all three for complete observability.",
  "explanation": "## The Three Pillars of Observability\n\n### Metrics\n**What**: Numerical measurements aggregated over time (CPU usage, request rate, error count)\n**When to use**: \n- Monitoring system health and performance trends\n- Setting up alerts and SLOs\n- Understanding resource utilization\n**Example**: `http_requests_total`, `memory_usage_bytes`\n\n### Logs\n**What**: Discrete event records with timestamps and context\n**When to use**:\n- Debugging specific issues\n- Auditing and compliance\n- Understanding what happened at a specific point in time\n**Example**: `[2025-12-13 10:30:45] ERROR: Database connection failed`\n\n### Traces\n**What**: End-to-end journey of a request through distributed systems\n**When to use**:\n- Identifying bottlenecks in microservices\n- Understanding service dependencies\n- Debugging latency issues across services\n**Example**: A single API call traced through API Gateway → Auth Service → Database\n\n### Why All Three?\nEach pillar answers different questions:\n- **Metrics**: \"Is there a problem?\"\n- **Logs**: \"What happened?\"\n- **Traces**: \"Where is the problem in the request flow?\"\n\nUsing all three together provides complete visibility into system behavior and enables faster incident resolution.",
