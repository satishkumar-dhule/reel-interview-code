  "answer": "Metrics, Goals, and Consequences.",
  "explanation": "1. **SLI (Indicator)**: The actual number. \"My latency is 200ms\".\n2. **SLO (Objective)**: The internal goal. \"Latency should be < 300ms for 99% of requests\".\n3. **SLA (Agreement)**: The legal contract with users. \"If latency > 500ms, we refund you 10%\".\n\n*SREs focus on SLOs. SLAs are for lawyers.*",
