  "question": "How does Terraform remote state prevent conflicts when multiple team members work on the same infrastructure?",
  "answer": "Remote state stores state file in shared location with locking to prevent simultaneous writes and state corruption.",
  "explanation": "## Concept Overview\nRemote state storage centralizes Terraform state files in a shared backend (like S3, Azure Blob Storage) with state locking mechanisms to prevent concurrent modifications.\n\n## Implementation Details\n- State backends store the .tfstate file remotely\n- Locking services (DynamoDB, Azure Blob Storage lease) prevent simultaneous writes\n- Teams can collaborate safely on the same infrastructure\n\n## Code Example\n```terraform\nterraform {\n  backend \"s3\" {\n    bucket         = \"my-terraform-state\"\n    key            = \"prod/terraform.tfstate\"\n    region         = \"us-east-1\"\n    dynamodb_table = \"terraform-locks\"\n    encrypt        = true\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Common Pitfalls\n- Forgetting to configure DynamoDB table for locking\n- Using local state in team environments\n- Not encrypting remote state files",
