  "question": "What is Docker and how does containerization differ from traditional virtualization?",
  "answer": "Docker is a containerization platform that packages applications with their dependencies into isolated containers. Unlike VMs, containers share the host OS kernel, making them lightweight and faster to start up.",
  "explanation": "# Docker Containerization\n\n## Key Concepts:\n- **Containers**: Isolated runtime environments that bundle applications with all dependencies\n- **Images**: Read-only templates used to create containers\n- **Dockerfile**: Text file with instructions to build Docker images\n\n## Benefits over Virtual Machines:\n- **Lightweight**: Share host OS kernel (no guest OS needed)\n- **Fast startup**: Seconds vs minutes for VMs\n- **Resource efficient**: Lower memory and CPU overhead\n- **Portability**: Run consistently across different environments\n\n## Common Use Cases:\n- Application deployment and scaling\n- Development environment consistency\n- Microservices architecture\n- CI/CD pipeline integration",
