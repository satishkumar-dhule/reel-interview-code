  "question": "What is Git and how does it facilitate collaborative software development through its distributed architecture?",
  "answer": "Git is a distributed version control system that tracks changes in source code, enabling multiple developers to work simultaneously on projects while maintaining a complete history of all modification",
  "explanation": "Git is a distributed version control system that revolutionized collaborative software development by providing a decentralized approach to code management.\n\n**Key Concepts:**\n- **Repository**: Complete project history with all files and metadata\n- **Commit**: Snapshot of changes with unique hash identifier\n- **Branch**: Independent line of development for features or fixes\n- **Merge**: Integration of changes from different branches\n- **Pull Request**: Mechanism for code review and integration\n- **Clone**: Local copy of remote repository\n- **Push/Pull**: Synchronize changes between local and remote repositories\n\n**Distributed Architecture Benefits:**\n- Every developer has full repository copy\n- Offline work capability\n- Faster operations (no network dependency)\n- Better backup and redundancy\n- Flexible collaboration workflows",
