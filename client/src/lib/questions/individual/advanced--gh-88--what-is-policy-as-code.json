  "explanation": "Policy as Code (PaC) is the practice of defining, managing, and automating policies using code and version control systems, similar to Infrastructure as Code (IaC). Instead of manually configuring policies through UIs or disparate systems, PaC allows organizations to express policies in a high-level, human-readable language, store them in a Git repository, and apply them automatically throughout the development lifecycle and in production environments.\n\n**Key Concepts:**\n1.  **Policy Definition:** Policies are written in a declarative language (e.g., Rego for Open Policy Agent, Sentinel for HashiCorp tools).\n2.  **Version Control:** Policies are stored in Git, enabling versioning, auditing, and collaboration.\n3.  **Automation:** Policies are automatically enforced at various stages (e.g., CI/CD pipeline, infrastructure provisioning, Kubernetes admission control).\n4.  **Shift Left:** Enables early detection and prevention of policy violations during development.\n5.  **Auditability:** Provides a clear audit trail of policy changes and enforcement.\n\n**Use Cases:**\n*   **Security:** Enforcing security best practices, such as disallowing public S3 buckets or ensuring encryption.\n*   **Compliance:** Meeting regulatory requirements (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA) by codifying compliance rules.\n*   **Cost Management:** Preventing the creation of overly expensive resources.\n*   **Operational Consistency:** Ensuring standardized configurations across environments.\n*   **Kubernetes Governance:** Controlling what can be deployed to a Kubernetes cluster (e.g., required labels, resource limits, image sources).\n\n**Popular Tools:**\n*   **Open Policy Agent (OPA):** An open-source, general-purpose policy engine.\n*   **HashiCorp Sentinel:** A policy as code framework embedded in HashiCorp enterprise products (Terraform, Vault, Nomad, Consul).\n*   **Kyverno:** A policy engine designed specifically for Kubernetes.\n*   Cloud provider specific tools (e.g., AWS Config Rules, Azure Policy).\n\n**Example (Conceptual OPA/Rego):**\n```rego\npackage main\n\n# Deny deployments if an image is not from a trusted registry\ndeny[msg] {\ninput.kind == \"Deployment\"\nimage_name := input.spec.template.spec.containers[_].image\nnot startswith(image_name, \"trusted.registry.io/\")\nmsg := sprintf(\"Image '%v' is not from a trusted registry\", [image_name])\n}\n```",
