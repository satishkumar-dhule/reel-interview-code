  "question": "Explain the CAP Theorem. Can you really 'choose two'?",
  "answer": "CAP states a distributed store can only provide 2 of 3: Consistency, Availability, Partition Tolerance.",
  "explanation": "**Partition Tolerance (P)** is NOT optional in distributed systems (networks fail). \n\nSo the real choice is **CP vs AP** during a partition:\n\n- **CP (Consistency)**: Return error/timeout if data can't be synced. (e.g., Banking - better to fail than show wrong balance).\n- **AP (Availability)**: Return stale data but keep running. (e.g., Facebook Feed - better to show old posts than nothing).\n\n**PACELC Theorem** extends this: Else (when no partition), choose Latency (L) vs Consistency (C).",
