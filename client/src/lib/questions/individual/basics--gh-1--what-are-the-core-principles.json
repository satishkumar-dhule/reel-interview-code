  "question": "What are the core principles and practices of DevOps, and how does it bridge the gap between development and operations teams?",
  "answer": "DevOps combines development and operations through automation, continuous integration/delivery, and shared responsibility for the entire software lifecycle.",
  "explanation": "DevOps is a cultural and technical movement that breaks down silos between development and operations teams. Key principles include:\n\n• **Automation**: Automating build, test, deployment, and infrastructure provisioning processes\n• **Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery (CI/CD)**: Frequent code integration and automated deployment pipelines\n• **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**: Managing infrastructure through version-controlled code\n• **Monitoring and Observability**: Real-time monitoring of applications and infrastructure\n• **Collaboration**: Shared ownership and responsibility across the entire software lifecycle\n• **Feedback Loops**: Quick feedback from production back to development teams\n\nDevOps practices enable faster delivery, improved quality, reduced deployment risks, and better alignment between business objectives and technical implementation.",
