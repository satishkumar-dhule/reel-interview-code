  "question": "How would you design a prompt-engineering system that dynamically selects between chain-of-thought, few-shot, and zero-shot prompting based on real-time performance metrics and task complexity?",
  "answer": "Implement a meta-learning classifier that evaluates task complexity, latency requirements, and accuracy thresholds to route to optimal prompting strategy.",
  "explanation": "## Concept Overview\nA dynamic prompt selection system uses meta-learning to choose the optimal prompting strategy based on real-time performance metrics and task characteristics.\n\n## Implementation Details\n- **Task Complexity Classifier**: Uses features like input length, domain specificity, and reasoning depth\n- **Performance Monitor**: Tracks latency, token usage, and accuracy for each strategy\n- **Strategy Router**: Implements weighted decision matrix balancing speed vs accuracy\n- **Feedback Loop**: Continuously updates strategy weights based on outcomes\n\n## Code Example\n```python\nclass PromptStrategySelector:\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.strategy_weights = {\n            'cot': 0.4, 'few_shot': 0.3, 'zero_shot': 0.3\n        }\n        self.performance_history = defaultdict(list)\n    \n    def select_strategy(self, task_features):\n        complexity = self.classify_complexity(task_features)\n        if complexity > 0.8:\n            return 'chain_of_thought'\n        elif task_features['has_examples']:\n            return 'few_shot'\n        else:\n            return 'zero_shot'\n```\n\n## Common Pitfalls\n- Overfitting to specific task types\n- Ignoring latency constraints in production\n- Failing to handle edge cases in strategy switching\n- Not accounting for model-specific optimizations",
