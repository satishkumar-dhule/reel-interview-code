  "question": "When would you choose a composite index over multiple single-column indexes in a relational database?",
  "answer": "For queries filtering on multiple columns together, composite indexes are more efficient than separate single-column indexes.",
  "explanation": "Composite indexes are optimal when queries frequently filter or sort on multiple columns simultaneously. They store data in a specific column order, allowing the database to satisfy query conditions using a single index lookup rather than multiple index scans. For example, a composite index on (last_name, first_name) efficiently handles queries like `WHERE last_name = 'Smith' AND first_name = 'John'`. However, composite indexes have higher write overhead and should be used judiciously based on query patterns.",
