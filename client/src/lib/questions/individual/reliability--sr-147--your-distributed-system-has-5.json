  "question": "Your distributed system has 5 microservices with the following failure rates: Service A (0.1%), Service B (0.2%), Service C (0.05%), Service D (0.15%), Service E (0.3%). Each request flows through all services sequentially. If your SLO requires 99.5% success rate and you process 1M requests daily, what's your current system reliability and how would you architect fault tolerance to meet the SLO?",
  "answer": "Current reliability: 99.2%. Need circuit breakers, retries, and service mesh to achieve 99.5% SLO.",
  "explanation": "## System Reliability Analysis\n\n### **Current State Calculation**\n\n**Sequential Service Chain Reliability:**\n- Service A: 99.9% (0.1% failure)\n- Service B: 99.8% (0.2% failure) \n- Service C: 99.95% (0.05% failure)\n- Service D: 99.85% (0.15% failure)\n- Service E: 99.7% (0.3% failure)\n\n**Overall System Reliability:**\n```\n0.999 × 0.998 × 0.9995 × 0.9985 × 0.997 = 0.9920 = 99.2%\n```\n\n**Daily Impact:**\n- 1M requests × 0.8% failure rate = 8,000 failed requests/day\n- **Gap to SLO:** 99.5% - 99.2% = 0.3% (3,000 requests)\n\n### **Fault Tolerance Architecture**\n\n#### **1. Circuit Breaker Pattern**\n- Implement per-service circuit breakers\n- Fast-fail on consecutive failures\n- Automatic recovery testing\n\n#### **2. Retry Strategy**\n- Exponential backoff with jitter\n- Maximum 3 retries per service\n- Timeout-based failure detection\n\n#### **3. Service Mesh Implementation**\n- **Istio/Linkerd** for traffic management\n- Automatic load balancing\n- Health check integration\n\n#### **4. Redundancy & Failover**\n- Deploy multiple instances per service\n- Cross-AZ deployment for availability\n- Database read replicas\n\n#### **5. Graceful Degradation**\n- Non-critical service bypass\n- Cached response fallbacks\n- Feature flags for service isolation\n\n**Expected Improvement:** With proper fault tolerance, achieve 99.6-99.8% reliability, exceeding the 99.5% SLO target.",
