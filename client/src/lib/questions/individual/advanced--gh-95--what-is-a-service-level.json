  "explanation": "A Service Level Indicator (SLI) is a quantitative measure of some aspect of the level of service provided to users. SLIs are the raw data points or metrics used to assess performance against Service Level Objectives (SLOs). They are crucial for objectively understanding how a service is performing from a user's perspective.\n\n**Key Characteristics of an SLI:**\n1.  **Quantitative Measure:** A specific, numerical value derived from system telemetry.\n2.  **User-Centric:** Reflects an aspect of service performance that directly impacts user experience.\n3.  **Directly Measurable:** Can be obtained from monitoring systems, logs, or other data sources.\n4.  **Good Proxy for User Happiness:** A change in the SLI should correlate with a change in user satisfaction.\n5.  **Reliably Measured:** The measurement itself should be accurate and dependable.\n\n**Common Types of SLIs:**\n*   **Availability:** Measures the proportion of time the service is usable or the percentage of successful requests.\n*   *Example:* (Number of successful HTTP requests / Total valid HTTP requests) * 100%.\n*   **Latency:** Measures the time taken to serve a request. Often measured at specific percentiles (e.g., 95th, 99th percentile) to understand typical and worst-case performance.\n*   *Example:* The 99th percentile of API response times for the `/users` endpoint over the last 5 minutes.\n*   **Error Rate:** Measures the proportion of requests that result in errors.\n*   *Example:* (Number of HTTP 5xx responses / Total valid HTTP requests) * 100%.\n*   **Throughput:** Measures the rate at which the system processes requests or data.\n*   *Example:* Requests per second (RPS) handled by the shopping cart service.\n*   **Durability:** Measures the likelihood that data stored in the system will be retained over a long period without corruption.\n*   *Example:* Probability of a stored object remaining intact and accessible after one year.\n*   **Correctness/Quality:** Measures if the service provides the right answer or performs the right action.\n*   *Example:* Percentage of search queries that return relevant results, or proportion of financial transactions processed without data errors.\n\n**How to Choose Good SLIs:**\n1.  **Focus on User Experience:** What aspects of performance or reliability are most important to your users?\n2.  **Keep it Simple:** Choose a small number of meaningful SLIs rather than trying to track everything.\n3.  **Ensure it's Actionable:** The SLI should provide data that can lead to improvements or inform decisions.\n4.  **Distinguish from Raw Metrics:** While SLIs are derived from metrics, they are specifically chosen and often processed (e.g., aggregated, percentiled) to represent service level.\n\n**Relationship with SLOs and SLAs:**\n*   SLIs are the **measurements**.\n*   SLOs are the **targets** for those measurements (e.g., SLI for availability >= 99.9%).\n*   SLAs are the **agreements** with users, often based on achieving certain SLOs, and typically include consequences if not met.\n\n**Example:**\n*   **User Journey:** User uploads a photo.\n*   **Possible SLIs:**\n*   `upload_success_rate`: (Number of successful photo uploads / Total photo upload attempts) * 100%\n*   `upload_latency_p95`: 95th percentile of time taken from initiating upload to confirmation.\n*   **Corresponding SLO for `upload_success_rate` might be:** 99.9% over a 7-day window.",
