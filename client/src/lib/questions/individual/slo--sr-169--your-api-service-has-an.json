  "question": "Your API service has an SLO of 99.9% availability. If you have 5 incidents this month with downtimes of 10min, 5min, 15min, 8min, and 12min, did you meet your SLO? (Assume 30-day month)",
  "answer": "No. Total downtime: 50min out of 43,200min = 99.88% availability, which violates 99.9% SLO",
  "explanation": "## Understanding SLO vs SLI\n\n**SLI (Service Level Indicator)**: The actual measured metric (e.g., uptime percentage)\n**SLO (Service Level Objective)**: The target threshold for the SLI\n\n## Calculation\n\n1. **Total minutes in 30 days**: 30 × 24 × 60 = 43,200 minutes\n2. **Total downtime**: 10 + 5 + 15 + 8 + 12 = 50 minutes\n3. **Uptime**: 43,200 - 50 = 43,150 minutes\n4. **Availability (SLI)**: (43,150 / 43,200) × 100 = 99.88%\n\n## Result\n\nSince 99.88% < 99.9%, you **did NOT meet** your SLO. You have an **error budget deficit** of 0.02%.\n\n## Error Budget\n\nWith a 99.9% SLO, you have a 0.1% error budget = 43.2 minutes/month. You used 50 minutes, exceeding the budget by 6.8 minutes.",
