  "question": "What are the key benefits of implementing an API Gateway in a microservices architecture, and how does it address common distributed system challenges?",
  "answer": "API Gateway provides centralized security, traffic management, monitoring, and service abstraction for microservices.",
  "explanation": "Key benefits include:\n\n**Security & Access Control:**\n- Centralized authentication and authorization\n- SSL/TLS termination and certificate management\n- API key management and validation\n- Protection against common attacks (DDoS, injection)\n\n**Traffic Management:**\n- Load balancing across service instances\n- Rate limiting and throttling\n- Request/response transformation and validation\n- Circuit breaker patterns for fault tolerance\n\n**Monitoring & Analytics:**\n- Centralized logging and metrics collection\n- Real-time API usage analytics\n- Performance monitoring and alerting\n- Request tracing across services\n\n**Developer Experience:**\n- Single entry point for all APIs\n- API versioning and backward compatibility\n- Documentation and testing interfaces\n- Simplified client integration",
