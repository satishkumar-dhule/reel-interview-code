  "question": "You have a staircase with n steps. You can climb 1, 2, or 3 steps at a time. How many distinct ways can you reach the top? Implement a solution with O(n) time and O(1) space complexity.",
  "answer": "Use DP with 3 variables tracking last 3 positions. dp[i] = dp[i-1] + dp[i-2] + dp[i-3]. Base: dp[0]=1, dp[1]=1, dp[2]=2",
  "explanation": "## Approach\n\nThis is a classic dynamic programming problem similar to climbing stairs, but with three possible steps instead of two.\n\n## Solution\n\n### Recurrence Relation\n\nFor each step `i`, the number of ways to reach it is the sum of ways to reach the previous three steps:\n\n```\ndp[i] = dp[i-1] + dp[i-2] + dp[i-3]\n```\n\n### Base Cases\n\n- `dp[0] = 1` (one way to stay at ground)\n- `dp[1] = 1` (one step)\n- `dp[2] = 2` (1+1 or 2)\n\n### Space Optimization\n\nInstead of maintaining an array of size n, we only need three variables to track the last three positions:\n\n```python\ndef climbStairs(n):\n    if n <= 2:\n        return n if n > 0 else 1\n    \n    a, b, c = 1, 1, 2  # dp[0], dp[1], dp[2]\n    \n    for i in range(3, n + 1):\n        current = a + b + c\n        a, b, c = b, c, current\n    \n    return c\n```\n\n## Complexity\n\n- **Time**: O(n) - single pass through n steps\n- **Space**: O(1) - only three variables used\n\n## Example\n\nFor n=4:\n- dp[3] = dp[2] + dp[1] + dp[0] = 2 + 1 + 1 = 4\n- dp[4] = dp[3] + dp[2] + dp[1] = 4 + 2 + 1 = 7\n\nThere are 7 distinct ways to climb 4 steps.",
