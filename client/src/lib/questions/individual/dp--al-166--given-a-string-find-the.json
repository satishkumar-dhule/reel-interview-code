  "question": "Given a string, find the minimum number of insertions and deletions to make it a palindrome. Each insertion costs 2, each deletion costs 1.",
  "answer": "Use DP with states (i,j) representing substring s[i..j] and compute min operations recursively.",
  "explanation": "This is a variation of the classic edit distance problem. We use DP where dp[i][j] = min operations to make substring s[i..j] a palindrome. If s[i] == s[j], dp[i][j] = dp[i+1][j-1] = 1 + min(dp[i+1][j-1], dp[i][j-1] + 1, dp[i+1][j] + 2). Base cases: i >= j return 0. The answer is dp[0][n-1].",
