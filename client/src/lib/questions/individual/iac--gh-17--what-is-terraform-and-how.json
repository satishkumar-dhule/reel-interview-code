  "question": "What is Terraform and how does it implement Infrastructure as Code (IaC) workflows?",
  "answer": "Terraform is an open-source Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tool by HashiCorp that allows you to define, provision, and manage cloud infrastructure using declarative configuration files.",
  "explanation": "Terraform enables infrastructure management through:\n\n- **Declarative Configuration**: Uses HCL (HashiCorp Configuration Language) to define desired infrastructure state\n- **Provider Architecture**: Supports multiple cloud providers (AWS, Azure, GCP, etc.) through plugins\n- **State Management**: Maintains a state file to track infrastructure resources and changes\n- **Workflow**: Follows plan-apply-destroy lifecycle for safe infrastructure changes\n- **Modularity**: Supports modules for reusable infrastructure components\n\n**Key Benefits**:\n- Version control infrastructure alongside application code\n- Automated provisioning and consistent deployments\n- Cost management through resource tracking\n- Multi-cloud and hybrid cloud support",
