  "question": "What's the difference between logs, metrics, and traces in observability?",
  "answer": "Logs: events, Metrics: numbers over time, Traces: request journeys.",
  "explanation": "**The Three Pillars of Observability**:\n\n1. **Logs**: Timestamped events showing what happened\n   - Structured logs with key-value pairs\n   - Error messages, debug info\n   - \"User login failed at 2:15 PM\"\n\n2. **Metrics**: Numerical data aggregated over time\n   - CPU usage, request count, error rate\n   - Charts and dashboards\n   - \"95th percentile latency: 200ms\"\n\n3. **Traces**: End-to-end request flow across services\n   - Shows path through distributed systems\n   - Identifies bottlenecks and failures\n   - \"API call took 500ms across 3 services\"\n\n**Why all three?** Logs tell you *what* happened, metrics show *how much*, traces reveal *where*.",
