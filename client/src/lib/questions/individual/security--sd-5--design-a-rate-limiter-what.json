  "question": "Design a Rate Limiter. What algorithms would you consider?",
  "answer": "Rate Limiting controls the amount of traffic sent or received by a network interface controller.",
  "explanation": "Prevents DoS attacks and resource starvation.\n\n**Algorithms**:\n1. **Token Bucket**: Tokens added at rate `r`. Request consumes token. Allows bursts.\n2. **Leaky Bucket**: Requests enter queue, processed at constant rate. Smooths traffic.\n3. **Fixed Window**: Count requests in 1s window. Edge case: 2x traffic at window boundary.\n4. **Sliding Window Log**: Precise but expensive (stores timestamps).\n\n**Implementation**: Redis (Lua scripts for atomicity).",
