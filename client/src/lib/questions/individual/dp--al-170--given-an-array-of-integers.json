  "question": "Given an array of integers where each element represents the maximum number of steps you can jump forward from that position, find the minimum number of jumps needed to reach the last index. If it's impossible, return -1. You can only move forward.",
  "answer": "Use greedy approach tracking current range and furthest reachable position in O(n) time.",
  "explanation": "This is a variation of the Jump Game II problem. The optimal solution uses a greedy approach:\n\n1. Keep track of the current range (end) where we can reach with the current number of jumps\n2. Track the furthest position we can reach within the next range (furthest)\n3. When we reach the end of the current range, we must make another jump\n4. Update the range to the furthest position we found\n\nTime complexity: O(n), Space complexity: O(1)\n\nThe key insight is that we don't need to explore all possible paths - we just need to know the furthest we can reach within each jump range.",
