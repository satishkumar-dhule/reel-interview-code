  "question": "What's the difference between hyperparameters and parameters in machine learning, and why is cross-validation important for selecting optimal hyperparameters?",
  "answer": "Parameters are learned during training, hyperparameters are set before training. Cross-validation prevents overfitting by testing hyperparameters on multiple data splits.",
  "explanation": "## Concept\n**Parameters**: Model weights learned from training data (like coefficients in linear regression). **Hyperparameters**: Configuration settings set before training (learning rate, regularization strength).\n\n## Implementation\n```python\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import GridSearchCV\nfrom sklearn.linear_model import Ridge\n\n# Hyperparameter tuning with cross-validation\nparam_grid = {'alpha': [0.1, 1.0, 10.0]}  # Regularization strength\nridge = Ridge()\ngrid_search = GridSearchCV(ridge, param_grid, cv=5)\ngrid_search.fit(X_train, y_train)\n```\n\n## Trade-offs\n- **More cross-validation folds**: More reliable estimates but slower training\n- **Larger hyperparameter space**: Better chance finding optimal values but exponential search time\n- **Regularization**: Reduces overfitting but may underfit if too strong\n\n## Pitfalls\n- Data leakage: Scaling before CV split contaminates validation\n- Overfitting to validation set with extensive hyperparameter search\n- Not using nested CV when comparing many hyperparameter combinations",
