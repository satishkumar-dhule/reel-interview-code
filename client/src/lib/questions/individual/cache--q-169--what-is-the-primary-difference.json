  "question": "What is the primary difference between cache-aside and read-through caching patterns?",
  "answer": "Cache-aside requires app to manage cache, while read-through handles cache automatically.",
  "explanation": "In cache-aside pattern, the application is responsible for checking cache first and loading data into cache when cache misses occur. The application code explicitly manages cache operations. In read-through pattern, the cache library handles this logic automatically - when cache misses occur, the cache itself loads data from the database and populates the cache. Read-through simplifies application code but may have less flexibility.",
