  "question": "What is Consistent Hashing and why is it critical for distributed caches?",
  "answer": "Consistent Hashing maps keys to a ring of nodes to minimize data movement when scaling.",
  "explanation": "In standard `hash(key) % N`, adding a node changes `N`, causing nearly ALL keys to remap (cache stampede).\n\n**Consistent Hashing** maps both servers and keys to a circle (0-360°). Keys map to the next server clockwise.\n\n**Benefit**: Adding/removing a node only affects the immediate neighbors (k/N keys move), not the whole cluster.\n\nUsed in: DynamoDB, Cassandra, Discord Ringpop.",
