  "question": "What is the difference between READ COMMITTED and REPEATABLE READ isolation levels in database transactions?",
  "answer": "READ COMMITTED sees only committed data, while REPEATABLE READ guarantees consistent reads within a transaction.",
  "explanation": "## Isolation Levels Overview\n\nDatabase isolation levels control how concurrent transactions interact with each other, preventing phenomena like dirty reads, non-repeatable reads, and phantom reads.\n\n## READ COMMITTED\n- Prevents dirty reads by only showing committed data\n- Allows non-repeatable reads (same query may return different results)\n- Most common default isolation level\n- Better concurrency but less consistency\n\n## REPEATABLE READ\n- Prevents dirty reads and non-repeatable reads\n- Guarantees same query returns same results within transaction\n- Uses MVCC or locking to maintain snapshot\n- May still allow phantom reads\n\n## Implementation Example\n\n```sql\n-- Set READ COMMITTED (default in many databases)\nSET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL READ COMMITTED;\nBEGIN;\nSELECT balance FROM accounts WHERE id = 1; -- Sees committed data only\nCOMMIT;\n\n-- Set REPEATABLE READ\nSET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL REPEATABLE READ;\nBEGIN;\nSELECT balance FROM accounts WHERE id = 1; -- Gets consistent snapshot\n-- Even if other transactions commit changes, this sees original data\nCOMMIT;\n```\n\n## Common Pitfalls\n- **Performance impact**: Higher isolation levels reduce concurrency\n- **Deadlock risk**: More locking increases deadlock probability\n- **Memory usage**: MVCC snapshots consume additional memory\n- **Application complexity**: Need to handle serialization failures",
