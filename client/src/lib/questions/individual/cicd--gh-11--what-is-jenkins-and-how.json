  "question": "What is Jenkins and how does it facilitate continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) in modern software development workflows?",
  "answer": "Jenkins is an open-source automation server that enables CI/CD by automating build, test, and deployment processes through extensible plugins and distributed architecture.",
  "explanation": "Jenkins is a powerful automation server that plays a crucial role in DevOps practices by enabling continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipelines.\n\n**Key Features:**\n- **Extensible Plugin System**: 1000+ plugins for integration with various tools\n- **Distributed Builds**: Master-agent architecture for scaling workloads\n- **Pipeline as Code**: Jenkinsfile for defining build workflows\n- **Built-in GUI**: Intuitive web interface for configuration and monitoring\n- **Automated Testing**: Integration with testing frameworks for quality assurance\n- **Deployment Automation**: Seamless integration with deployment tools\n\n**Architecture Components:**\n- **Jenkins Master**: Orchestrates builds and manages agents\n- **Jenkins Agents**: Execute build tasks in distributed environments\n- **Pipeline Engine**: Processes Jenkinsfile definitions\n- **Plugin Ecosystem**: Extends functionality for various tools and platforms",
