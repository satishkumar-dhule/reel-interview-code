  "question": "How does TCP's congestion control algorithm interact with HTTP/2's multiplexing when multiple streams compete for bandwidth?",
  "answer": "TCP treats all HTTP/2 streams as one connection, so congestion control affects all streams equally, causing head-of-line blocking.",
  "explanation": "## Concept Overview\nTCP's congestion control operates at the transport layer, managing the entire connection's throughput regardless of how many application-layer streams (HTTP/2) are multiplexed over it.\n\n## Implementation Details\n- TCP uses algorithms like Reno, CUBIC, or BBR to adjust cwnd based on packet loss/RTT\n- HTTP/2 multiplexes multiple streams over a single TCP connection\n- All streams share the same congestion window and experience identical throttling\n\n## Common Pitfalls\n- Assuming per-stream bandwidth allocation\n- Ignoring that packet loss affects all streams simultaneously\n- Not considering TCP head-of-line blocking despite HTTP/2 stream multiplexing\n\n## Code Example\n```go\n// HTTP/2 client configuration\nclient := &http.Client{\n    Transport: &http2.Transport{\n        // Single TCP connection for all streams\n        AllowHTTP: false,\n    },\n}\n```",
