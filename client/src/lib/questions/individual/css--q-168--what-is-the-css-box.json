  "question": "What is the CSS 'box model' and what are its four main components?",
  "answer": "The CSS box model consists of content, padding, border, and margin that surround every HTML element.",
  "explanation": "The CSS box model is a fundamental concept that describes how every HTML element is rendered as a rectangular box. It consists of four layers:\n\n1. **Content**: The actual content of the element (text, images, etc.)\n2. **Padding**: The space between the content and the border\n3. **Border**: The border that surrounds the padding\n4. **Margin**: The space outside the border that separates the element from other elements\n\nThe total width of an element is calculated as: width + padding-left + padding-right + border-left + border-right + margin-left + margin-right. Understanding the box model is crucial for layout and spacing in CSS.",
