  "question": "You have an EC2 instance that suddenly becomes unresponsive. What steps would you take to troubleshoot this issue, and what AWS tools would you use?",
  "answer": "Check CloudWatch metrics, use EC2 Serial Console, examine system logs, and verify security group/network ACLs.",
  "explanation": "When an EC2 instance becomes unresponsive, follow this troubleshooting approach:\n\n1. **Check CloudWatch Metrics**: Monitor CPUUtilization, NetworkIn/Out, and StatusCheckFailed metrics to identify resource exhaustion or hardware issues.\n\n2. **Use EC2 Serial Console**: Connect via serial console for OS-level access even when SSH is unavailable, allowing you to check system logs and processes.\n\n3. **Examine System Logs**: Review system logs through CloudWatch Logs or by attaching the root volume to another instance to investigate crash dumps or error messages.\n\n4. **Verify Network Configuration**: Check security groups and network ACLs to ensure proper connectivity. Confirm that the instance still has a public IP if required.\n\n5. **Check Instance Status**: Use AWS Systems Manager to check if the instance is running and responsive to AWS API calls.\n\n6. **Reboot or Recover**: If necessary, use the AWS Console reboot function, or as a last resort, stop and restart the instance.",
