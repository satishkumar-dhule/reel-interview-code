  "question": "How do ACID properties ensure data integrity in a banking transaction where $100 is transferred from Account A to Account B?",
  "answer": "Atomicity ensures all-or-nothing execution, Consistency maintains valid states, Isolation prevents interference, Durability guarantees persistence.",
  "explanation": "**Banking Transfer Scenario**: Account A transfers $100 to Account B\n\n• **Atomicity**: Either both debit from A AND credit to B succeed, or both fail and rollback completely\n• **Consistency**: Database maintains valid state - total money remains constant, account balances never go negative\n• **Isolation**: Concurrent transactions see consistent snapshots - if Account C checks A's balance during transfer, they see either before or after state, never partial\n• **Durability**: Once transaction commits, changes persist even through system crashes via Write-Ahead Logging",
