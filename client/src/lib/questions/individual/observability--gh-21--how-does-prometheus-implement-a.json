  "question": "How does Prometheus implement a pull-based monitoring system, and what are the key components in its architecture?",
  "answer": "Prometheus uses pull-based metric collection with a time-series database, query language (PromQL), and alerting system for monitoring cloud-native applications.",
  "explanation": "Prometheus is a cloud-native monitoring system that scrapes metrics from HTTP endpoints:\n\n## Core Components\n- **Prometheus Server**: Collects and stores time-series data\n- **Exporters**: Expose metrics in Prometheus format\n- **Service Discovery**: Automatically finds monitoring targets\n- **Alertmanager**: Manages alert routing and notification\n- **PromQL**: Query language for time-series analysis\n\n## Key Features\n- Pull-based metric collection (configurable scrape intervals)\n- Multi-dimensional data model with labels\n- Powerful query capabilities for aggregation and filtering\n- Built-in alerting with notification integration\n- Time-series data compression and retention policies",
