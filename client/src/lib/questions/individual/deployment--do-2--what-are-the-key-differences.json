  "question": "What are the key differences between Blue/Green and Canary deployment strategies?",
  "answer": "Blue/Green enables instant switching between environments, while Canary gradually shifts traffic for safer rollouts.",
  "explanation": "**Blue/Green Deployment:**\n- Maintains two identical production environments (Blue=current, Green=new)\n- Deploy new version to Green environment and test thoroughly\n- Switch load balancer to route 100% traffic to Green instantly\n- Enables immediate rollback but requires double infrastructure resources\n\n**Canary Deployment:**\n- Gradually routes small percentage of traffic to new version\n- Start with 5% traffic to new version, monitor metrics and errors\n- Incrementally increase to 25%, 50%, then 100% based on performance\n- Lower risk and resource usage but slower deployment process",
