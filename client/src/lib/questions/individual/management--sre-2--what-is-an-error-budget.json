  "question": "What is an Error Budget and how do you use it?",
  "answer": "100% - SLO = Error Budget. It's the allowed amount of unreliability.",
  "explanation": "If SLO is 99.9% uptime, you have 0.1% error budget (approx 43 mins/month).\n\n**Usage**:\n- **Budget Remaining?**: Ship features fast, take risks, do chaos engineering.\n- **Budget Exhausted?**: FREEZE deployments. Focus 100% on reliability until budget recovers.\n\n*It aligns Dev (speed) and Ops (stability) incentives.*",
