  "question": "What is a closure in JavaScript and how does it enable data encapsulation?",
  "answer": "A closure is when a function remembers and accesses variables from its outer lexical scope, even after the outer function has finished executing.",
  "explanation": "## Concept Overview\nA closure is a fundamental JavaScript concept where an inner function maintains access to variables in its outer (lexical) scope, even when the outer function has completed execution. This creates a private scope for data encapsulation.\n\n## Implementation Details\n- Closures are created automatically when functions are defined inside other functions\n- The inner function retains a reference to the outer function's variables\n- This enables private variables and methods, similar to object-oriented encapsulation\n- Memory is managed automatically - closures persist as long as references exist\n\n## Code Example\n```javascript\nfunction createCounter() {\n  let count = 0; // Private variable\n  \n  return {\n    increment: function() {\n      count++; // Accesses outer scope variable\n      return count;\n    },\n    decrement: function() {\n      count--;\n      return count;\n    },\n    getCount: function() {\n      return count;\n    }\n  };\n}\n\nconst counter = createCounter();\nconsole.log(counter.increment()); // 1\nconsole.log(counter.increment()); // 2\nconsole.log(counter.getCount());  // 2\n```\n\n## Common Pitfalls\n- **Memory leaks**: Closures can prevent garbage collection if references persist unnecessarily\n- **Loop confusion**: Variables in closures capture by reference, not value (use `let` or IIFE)\n- **Performance impact**: Creating many closures can affect memory usage\n- **`this` binding**: Arrow functions don't have their own `this`, which affects closure behavior",
