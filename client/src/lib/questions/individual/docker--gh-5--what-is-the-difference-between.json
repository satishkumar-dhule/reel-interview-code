  "question": "What is the difference between Docker Image and Docker Container?",
  "answer": "Docker Image is a read-only template/blueprint, while Docker Container is a running instance of that image.",
  "explanation": "- **Docker Image:** A read-only template containing application code, runtime, libraries, dependencies, and system tools. Images are built from Dockerfiles and stored in registries. They serve as blueprints for creating containers.\n\n- **Docker Container:** A runnable instance of an image. Containers are isolated processes that can be created, started, stopped, and deleted. Multiple containers can run from the same image simultaneously.\n\n- **Key Differences:**\n  - Images are immutable templates; containers are mutable runtime instances\n  - Images are stored; containers are executed\n  - One image can spawn multiple containers\n  - Containers have their own filesystem layer on top of the image",
