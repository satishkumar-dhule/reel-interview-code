  "question": "What is Performance Testing and how does it differ from Load and Stress Testing?",
  "answer": "Performance testing evaluates system responsiveness, stability, and scalability under various workloads to identify bottlenecks and validate requirements.",
  "explanation": "Performance Testing is a comprehensive testing approach that evaluates how a system performs under different conditions. It encompasses several testing types:\n\n**Key Performance Testing Types:**\n1. **Load Testing:** Tests system performance under expected user loads\n2. **Stress Testing:** Pushes system beyond normal capacity to find breaking points\n3. **Endurance Testing:** Validates performance over extended periods\n4. **Spike Testing:** Tests response to sudden traffic increases\n\n**Essential Performance Metrics:**\n- **Response Time:** Time taken to process requests\n- **Throughput:** Number of transactions per time unit\n- **Resource Utilization:** CPU, memory, disk, network usage\n- **Concurrency:** Number of simultaneous users handled\n- **Error Rate:** Percentage of failed requests\n\n**Common Tools:**\n- Apache JMeter, Gatling, k6 for load generation\n- New Relic, Datadog for monitoring\n- Grafana for visualization\n\n**Real-world Example:**\nAn e-commerce site performs load testing before Black Friday to ensure it can handle 10,000 concurrent users with <2 second response times.",
