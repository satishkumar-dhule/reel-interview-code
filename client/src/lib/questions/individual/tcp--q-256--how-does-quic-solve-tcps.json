  "question": "How does QUIC solve TCP's head-of-line blocking problem in HTTP/2 multiplexing, and what are the implementation trade-offs?",
  "answer": "QUIC eliminates head-of-line blocking using stream-independent packet delivery over UDP, allowing lost packets to only affect their specific stream.",
  "explanation": "## Concept Overview\nHead-of-line blocking occurs when a single lost packet blocks all subsequent packets, even those belonging to different streams. This affects HTTP/2 over TCP significantly.\n\n## Implementation Details\n- **TCP Approach**: All multiplexed streams share one TCP connection. Packet loss blocks entire connection.\n- **QUIC Approach**: Each QUIC stream operates independently. Lost packets only block their specific stream.\n- QUIC uses connection IDs (not IP+port) for connection identification and migration.\n\n## Code Example\n```bash\n# TCP (HTTP/2) - blocked by single loss\nStream 1: [P1][P2][LOSS][P4] - BLOCKS\nStream 2: [Q1][Q2][Q3][Q4] - BLOCKED despite no loss\n\n# QUIC (HTTP/3) - independent streams\nStream 1: [P1][P2][LOSS][P4] - PARTIAL BLOCK\nStream 2: [Q1][Q2][Q3][Q4] - CONTINUES normally\n```\n\n## Common Pitfalls\n- Increased CPU overhead due to user-space encryption\n- UDP blocked by some corporate firewalls\n- Connection state management complexity\n- Bandwidth estimation challenges in multiplexed streams",
