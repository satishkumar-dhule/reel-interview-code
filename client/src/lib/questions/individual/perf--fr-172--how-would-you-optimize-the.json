  "question": "How would you optimize the rendering performance of a React component that displays a large list (10,000+ items) with frequent updates?",
  "answer": "Use virtualization, memoization, and debounced updates to minimize re-renders and DOM nodes.",
  "explanation": "For large lists with frequent updates, implement several performance optimizations:\n\n1. **Virtualization**: Only render visible items using libraries like react-window or react-virtualized. This reduces DOM nodes from 10,000+ to ~20-50 visible items.\n\n2. **Memoization**: Wrap list items in React.memo() to prevent unnecessary re-renders when props haven't changed.\n\n3. **Debouncing**: Debounce rapid updates (like search/filter) to batch changes and reduce render frequency.\n\n4. **Key optimization**: Use stable, unique keys (not array indices) to help React identify which items changed.\n\n5. **State management**: Consider using useReducer for complex list state to minimize state updates.\n\n6. **CSS containment**: Use `contain: strict` on list containers to isolate layout calculations.\n\nThese techniques combined can reduce render time from seconds to milliseconds.",
