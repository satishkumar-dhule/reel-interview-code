  "question": "What are the four key DORA metrics for measuring DevOps performance?",
  "answer": "DORA metrics are deployment frequency, lead time for changes, change failure rate, and time to restore service.",
  "explanation": "## Concept Overview\nDORA metrics are industry-standard measurements that correlate with high-performing DevOps teams. They provide quantitative insights into software delivery and operational performance.\n\n## Implementation\n```typescript\ninterface DORAMetrics {\n  deploymentFrequency: number; // deployments per week\n  leadTimeForChanges: number;  // minutes from commit to production\n  changeFailureRate: number;   // percentage of failed deployments\n  timeToRestoreService: number; // minutes to recover from failure\n}\n\n// Calculate change failure rate\nconst calculateCFR = (failedDeployments: number, totalDeployments: number) => {\n  return (failedDeployments / totalDeployments) * 100;\n};\n```\n\n## Trade-offs\n**Pros:**\n- Industry-standardized benchmarks\n- Direct correlation with organizational performance\n- Actionable insights for improvement\n\n**Cons:**\n- Can encourage gaming the metrics\n- May not capture context-specific factors\n- Requires reliable data collection\n\n## Common Pitfalls\n- Focusing on individual metrics in isolation\n- Ignoring qualitative factors like team morale\n- Not establishing baseline measurements before optimization\n- Collecting data without acting on insights",
