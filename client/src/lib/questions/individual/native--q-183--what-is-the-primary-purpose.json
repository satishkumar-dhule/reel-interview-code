  "question": "What is the primary purpose of Native Modules in React Native?",
  "answer": "To access native platform APIs and functionality not available in JavaScript.",
  "explanation": "Native Modules bridge the gap between JavaScript and native platform code (Java/Kotlin for Android, Objective-C/Swift for iOS). They allow React Native apps to access device-specific features like camera, Bluetooth, GPS, or custom native libraries that aren't exposed through React Native's built-in components. Native Modules create a communication layer where JavaScript can call native methods and receive callbacks, enabling developers to leverage the full power of the underlying platform while maintaining a React Native development experience.",
