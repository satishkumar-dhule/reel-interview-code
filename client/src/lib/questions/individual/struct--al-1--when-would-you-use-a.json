  "question": "When would you use a Linked List over an Array?",
  "answer": "Linked Lists excel at insertions/deletions, Arrays excel at random access.",
  "explanation": "**Array**:\n- Access: O(1) (Direct memory address)\n- Insert/Delete: O(n) (Shift elements)\n- Memory: Contiguous\n\n**Linked List**:\n- Access: O(n) (Traversal)\n- Insert/Delete: O(1) (Change pointer - if you have the node)\n- Memory: Scattered (Heap)\n\n**Use List when**: Implementing Queues, Stacks, or when memory is fragmented.",
  "diagram": "\ngraph LR\n    subgraph Array\n    A1[0] --- A2[1] --- A3[2] --- A4[3]\n    end\n    subgraph LinkedList\n    L1[Node] --> L2[Node] --> L3[Node]\n    end\n",
