## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| No questions found | Check database, remove filters |
| Not suitable for poll | Question needs multiple choice options |
| Token expired | Get new access token (expires after 60 days) |
| API error 403 | Request "Share on LinkedIn" product access |
| API error 429 | Rate limited, reduce posting frequency |

### Debug Commands
```bash
# Test database connection
node -e "import('./script/utils.js').then(m => m.dbClient.execute('SELECT COUNT(*) FROM questions').then(r => console.log('Questions:', r.rows[0])))"

# Check specific question
node -e "import('./script/utils.js').then(m => m.dbClient.execute({sql: 'SELECT * FROM questions WHERE id = ?', args: ['q-123']}).then(r => console.log(r.rows[0])))"

# Test with dry run
DRY_RUN=true node script/post-linkedin-poll.js
```

4. Respond to comments
5. Share correct answer after poll closes
6. Rotate between channels
7. Mix difficulty levels
8. Track engagement metrics

### Database Schema
Questions table must have:
