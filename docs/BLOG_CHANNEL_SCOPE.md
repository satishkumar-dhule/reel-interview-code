## Rationale

### Why These Channels?

1. **High Demand**: These are the fastest-growing and most critical areas in tech
2. **Production Focus**: Infrastructure, platform, and AI topics directly affect production systems
3. **Deep Expertise Required**: Complex topics benefit from detailed blog coverage
4. **Real-World Impact**: These technologies power modern cloud-native applications
5. **Career Value**: High-paying roles in infrastructure, platform, and AI engineering
6. **Content Scarcity**: Less generic content available for production-level challenges

### Why Not Other Channels?

Other channels (frontend, backend, algorithms, databases) are:
- Well-covered by existing resources
- Better suited for Q&A format
- Less likely to have compelling production case studies
- More fundamental/educational vs. operations-focused

## Implementation

### Code Location
```javascript
// script/generate-blog.js
const ALLOWED_BLOG_CHANNELS = [
  'sre',
  'devops',
  'kubernetes',
  'aws',
  'terraform',
  'docker',
  'linux',
  'unix',
  'generative-ai',
  'llm-ops',
  'machine-learning',
  'prompt-engineering'
];
```

### SQL Filter
```sql
SELECT q.id, q.question, q.answer, q.explanation, q.diagram, 
       q.difficulty, q.tags, q.channel, q.sub_channel, q.companies
FROM questions q
LEFT JOIN blog_posts bp ON q.id = bp.question_id
WHERE bp.id IS NULL
  AND q.explanation IS NOT NULL 
  AND LENGTH(q.explanation) > 100
  AND q.channel IN ('sre', 'devops', 'kubernetes', 'aws', 'terraform', 
                     'docker', 'linux', 'unix', 'generative-ai', 
                     'llm-ops', 'machine-learning', 'prompt-engineering')
ORDER BY 
  (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM blog_posts WHERE channel = q.channel) ASC,
  RANDOM()
LIMIT 1
```

## Channel Distribution Strategy

The system ensures balanced coverage:

1. **Priority to Underrepresented**: Channels with fewer blogs get priority
2. **Random Within Priority**: Prevents predictable patterns
3. **Quality Over Quantity**: Each blog must pass quality gates

### Example Distribution
```
SRE:                 ████████░░ 15 blogs
DevOps:              ██████████ 18 blogs
Generative AI:       ████░░░░░░  8 blogs  ← Next priority
LLM Ops:             ██████░░░░ 12 blogs
Machine Learning:    ████████░░ 14 blogs
Prompt Engineering:  ██░░░░░░░░  4 blogs  ← Highest priority
```

## Monitoring

Track blog distribution by channel:

```bash
# Check current distribution
sqlite3 questions.db "
  SELECT channel, COUNT(*) as count 
  FROM blog_posts 
  WHERE channel IN ('sre', 'devops', 'generative-ai', 'llm-ops', 'machine-learning', 'prompt-engineering')
  GROUP BY channel 
  ORDER BY count DESC
"
```

## Adding New Channels

To add a new channel to blog generation:

1. **Update the constant**:
   ```javascript
   // script/generate-blog.js
   const ALLOWED_BLOG_CHANNELS = [
     'sre',
     'devops',
     'generative-ai',
     'llm-ops',
     'machine-learning',
     'prompt-engineering',
     'new-channel-id'  // Add here
   ];
   ```

2. **Verify questions exist**:
   ```sql
   SELECT COUNT(*) FROM questions WHERE channel = 'new-channel-id';
   ```

3. **Test generation**:
   ```bash
   node script/generate-blog.js
   ```

## Removing Channels

To remove a channel from blog generation:

1. Remove from `ALLOWED_BLOG_CHANNELS` array
2. Existing blogs remain published
3. No new blogs will be generated for that channel

## Benefits

### For Content Quality
- ✅ Deeper technical coverage
- ✅ More relevant real-world examples
- ✅ Better case studies from production systems
- ✅ Higher expertise required = better content

### For Readers
- ✅ Focused on high-value topics
- ✅ Production-ready insights
- ✅ Career-advancing knowledge
- ✅ Less noise, more signal

### For Maintenance
- ✅ Easier to maintain quality standards
- ✅ More consistent voice and depth
- ✅ Better source availability

## Future Considerations

Potential channels to add:
- **Cloud Architecture** (AWS, GCP, Azure specific)
- **Data Engineering** (if distinct from ML)
- **Security Engineering** (AppSec, DevSecOps)
- **Platform Engineering** (Internal developer platforms)

Criteria for addition:
1. Sufficient question volume (100+ questions)
2. Production-focused (not educational basics)
3. Real-world case studies available
4. High career value
5. Distinct from existing channels

## FAQ

**Q: Why not generate blogs for all channels?**
A: Quality over quantity. Focused channels allow deeper, more authoritative content.

**Q: What happens to questions in other channels?**
A: They remain available in Q&A format, which suits them better.

**Q: Can I manually generate a blog for a non-allowed channel?**
A: Yes, but it won't happen automatically. You'd need to modify the code temporarily.

**Q: How often are blogs generated?**
A: Daily via GitHub Actions workflow, one blog per run.

**Q: Will this change over time?**
A: Yes, as new high-value domains emerge (e.g., quantum computing, edge AI).

## Summary

Blog generation is strategically limited to:
- SRE
- DevOps  
- Generative AI
- LLM Ops
- Machine Learning
- Prompt Engineering

This ensures deep, production-focused content in the most impactful technical domains.
